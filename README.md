# PiSpeedCamera

Driving around Ithaca is challenging due to the narrow streets with steep slopes and sharp turns. Speed limitation is a good way to ensure safety drive under such road conditions. The PiSpeed Camera project intends to implement a device that can be placed at the roadside measuring the speed of passing vehicles. We used a Raspberry Pi 4 to be our microcontroller; two ultrasonic sensors to measure and calculate the speed of cars; and a Raspberry Pi Camera to capture and image of the license plate. We used the OpenCV library to process the captured image to crop the area of the license plate. Finally, we used the optical character recognition (OCR) to transform the image into text information. We also set up a local server on Raspberry Pi so that the history of detected overspeed car with its license plate can be displayed on a website.
